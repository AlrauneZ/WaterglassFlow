# Overview

This project provides all python scripts to reproduce the results of the 
paper "Groundwater flow below construction pits and erosion of temporary 
horizontal layers of silicate grouting" by Joris M. Dekker, Thomas Sweijen, 
Alraune Zech; Hydrogeology Journal
https://doi.org/10.1007/s10040-020-02246-3

It provides the functional implementations for description of waterglass 
flow pattern below a construction pit. It further provides simulation results 
of simulations presented in the manuscript and python scripts to reproduce all 
figures (including those of the Supporting Information) based on the input data. 

## Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `README.md` - description of the project
- `LICENSE` - the default license is MIT
- `data/` - folder containing data:
  + `modlfow_head_t0.csv` - simulated heads at initial state (Fig. 2)
  + `modlfow_head_tinf.csv` - simulated heads at final state (Fig. 2) 
  + `data_heads_layer_t0.csv` - simulated heads in layers at initial state (Fig. 3)
  + `data_heads_layer_tend.csv` - simulated heads in layers  at final state (Fig. 3) 
  + `Fluxes_Modflow_standard.csv` - simulated fluxes from Modflow (Fig. 4 & 5) 
  + `velocity_x_tinf.csv` - simulated velcities from Modflow (Fig. S01) 
  + `velocity_z_tinf.csv` - simulated velcities from Modflow (Fig. S01) 
  + `data_headprofiles_t0_SI.csv` - observational data of head (Fig S04)
  + `data_reldiff_L_H1.csv` - simulated data (Modflow) for variations in L (Fig S05)
  + `data_reldiff_H_L50.csv` - simulated data (Modflow) for variations in H (Fig S06)
  + `data_reldiff_D.csv` - simulated data (Modflow) for variations in D (Fig S07)
- `src/` - folder containing the Python scripts of the project:
  + `Class_Waterglas.py` - containg classes and function as implementations:
      - of the analytical solutions describing flow pattern of waterglass in 
        construction pit
